### How To Install | Update

Download the latest release of the repo, open the zip and remove the Readme.Md and .git folder, then import it into the Twitch/Curse launcher.

Open the Minecraft settings for Twitch/Curse, and make sure you're assigning at LEAST 5 1/2 GB of RAM.

Make sure you're using the latest Java 8 release, and in the bottom box for additional JVM flags, copy/paste the following:

-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:+UseLargePagesInMetaspace -Dio.netty.leakDetection.level=simple -Dfml.queryResult=confirm -Dfml.ignorePatchDiscrepancies=true -Dfml.ignoreInvalidMinecraftCertificates=true

For cracked clients, you'll need to use a cracked client and install by hand, you'll need to be creative and manualyl create a forge profile.

You can also use the other repo, but it's out of date.

### System Requirements
You'll need Java 8, and at LEAST 6 GB (I personally allot 10 just for shits and giggles) of RAM to spare for the pack.

This pack is semi-toaster friendly, some getting 100+ fps in-game on dual core machines with tweaked configurations.

This is not a promised performance rating as all hardware configs and setups vary, but it is common using stock settings I ship.
