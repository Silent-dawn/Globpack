### How To Install | Update

Download the latest copy of the repo, extract the zip inside of the zip, and import it into the Twitch/Curse launcher.

For cracked clients, you'll need to use a cracked client and install by hand, you'll need to be creative, including a forge profile.

You can also use the other repo, but it's out of date.

### System Requirements
You'll need Java 8, and at LEAST 6 GB (I personally allot 10 just for shits and giggles) of RAM to spare for the pack.

This pack is semi-toaster friendly, some getting 100+ fps in-game on dual core machines with tweaked configurations.

This is not a promised performance rating as all hardware configs and setups vary, but it is common using stock settings I ship.
