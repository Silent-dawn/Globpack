The Official Server I'm testing and building on is Dynmap equipped, so you can check out the map here: [Live Map](http://69.162.112.90:8123/)

Do note however, not all mods are supported by Dynmap so not all blocks rendered are correct.

You can however talk to players in-game using the live map if you want.

The Server is closed access, only for those helping test and develop.

### How To Install | Update

Download the latest copy of the repo, and import it into the Twitch/Curse launcher.

For cracked clients, you'll need to use a cracked client and install by hand, you'll need to be creative.

You can also use the other repo, but it's out of date.

### System Requirements
You'll need Java 8, and at LEAST 6 GB (I personally allot 10 just for shits and giggles) of ram to spare for the pack.

This pack is semi-toaster friendly, some getting 100+ fps in-game on dual core machines with tweaked configurations.
